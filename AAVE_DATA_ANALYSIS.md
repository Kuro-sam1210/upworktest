# Aave Governance Data Analysis

## 🔍 Your Current Data Issues

Looking at your output:

```javascript
{
  id: '32',
  state: 32n,  // ❌ WRONG - should be 0-7
  proposer: '0x32a9d6A550C3D89284D5700F7d7758dBc6f0fB2C',
  startBlock: '1360677416112862721206464558277695108377000585429',  // ❌ WRONG - way too large
  endBlock: '544',  // ⚠️ Should be endTime (timestamp), not block number
  forVotes: '608',
  againstVotes: '672',
  abstainVotes: '800',  // ⚠️ Not in ABI return
}
```

## ❌ Problems Identified

### 1. **State Value is Wrong**

- **Your value**: `32n` (BigInt)
- **Expected**: `0-7` (uint8)
- **Issue**: ABI parsing error or wrong contract method

### 2. **startBlock is Wrong**

- **Your value**: `'1360677416112862721206464558277695108377000585429'` (way too large)
- **Expected**: `startTime` (uint40 timestamp, e.g., `1704067200`)
- **Issue**: Getting wrong field or data misalignment

### 3. **endBlock vs endTime**

- **Your value**: `'544'` (looks like block number)
- **Expected**: `endTime` (uint40 timestamp)
- **Issue**: Field name mismatch

### 4. **Missing Critical Fields**

- ❌ `executed` (bool) - Is proposal executed?
- ❌ `canceled` (bool) - Was proposal canceled?
- ❌ `title` - Proposal title (from IPFS)
- ❌ `description` - Proposal description (from IPFS)
- ❌ `ipfsHash` - IPFS hash for metadata

### 5. **Unexpected Field**

- ⚠️ `abstainVotes` - Not in Aave Governance V3 ABI return

---

## ✅ What You Should Have

Based on the ABI in your code:

```javascript
"function getProposal(uint256 proposalId) view returns (
  uint256 id,
  address creator,
  uint40 startTime,    // ← Timestamp, not block number
  uint40 endTime,      // ← Timestamp, not block number
  uint256 forVotes,
  uint256 againstVotes,
  uint8 state,         // ← Should be 0-7
  bool executed,       // ← Missing
  bool canceled        // ← Missing
)"
```

### Expected Data Structure:

```javascript
{
  id: '32',
  creator: '0x32a9d6A550C3D89284D5700F7d7758dBc6f0fB2C',  // Not "proposer"
  startTime: 1704067200,      // Unix timestamp (uint40)
  endTime: 1704153600,        // Unix timestamp (uint40)
  forVotes: '608',
  againstVotes: '672',
  state: 2,                   // 0-7 (uint8)
  executed: false,           // bool
  canceled: false,            // bool

  // These come from IPFS (not on-chain):
  title: 'AIP-32: Proposal Title',
  description: 'Full proposal description...',
  ipfsHash: 'QmXxxx...'
}
```

---

## 🎯 Is This Data Enough?

### ❌ **NO - Missing Critical Information:**

1. **Status Flags Missing:**
   - `executed` - Can't tell if proposal was executed
   - `canceled` - Can't tell if proposal was canceled
   - `state` is wrong (32n instead of 0-7)

2. **Timing Information Wrong:**
   - `startBlock` is invalid (way too large)
   - `endBlock` should be `endTime` (timestamp)
   - Can't calculate time remaining or check if proposal is active

3. **User Experience Missing:**
   - No `title` - Users see "Proposal 32" instead of actual title
   - No `description` - Can't show what the proposal is about
   - No `ipfsHash` - Can't fetch rich metadata

4. **Voting Data:**
   - `abstainVotes` appears but isn't in ABI - might be from wrong source

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Fixed

### 1. **Fix ABI Parsing**

The data structure suggests either:

- Wrong ABI definition
- Incorrect parsing of return values
- Calling wrong contract method

### 2. **Get Correct Return Values**

Ensure you're parsing the tuple correctly:

```javascript
const [
  id,
  creator,
  startTime,
  endTime,
  forVotes,
  againstVotes,
  state,
  executed,
  canceled,
] = await governanceContract.getProposal(proposalId);
```

### 3. **Add IPFS Fetching**

For title/description:

```javascript
// After getting on-chain data, fetch IPFS metadata
if (proposal.ipfsHash) {
  const metadata = await fetchFromIPFS(proposal.ipfsHash);
  proposal.title = metadata.title;
  proposal.description = metadata.description;
}
```

### 4. **Fix State Value**

The state `32n` suggests:

- Data misalignment in parsing
- Wrong field being read
- Need to verify ABI matches actual contract

---

## 📊 Minimum Required Data for Widget

### **Essential (Must Have):**

- ✅ `id` - Proposal ID
- ✅ `forVotes` - For votes count
- ✅ `againstVotes` - Against votes count
- ❌ `state` - Current state (0-7) - **FIX NEEDED**
- ❌ `executed` - Execution status - **MISSING**
- ❌ `canceled` - Cancel status - **MISSING**
- ❌ `startTime` - Start timestamp - **WRONG (startBlock)**
- ❌ `endTime` - End timestamp - **WRONG (endBlock)**

### **Important (Should Have):**

- ❌ `title` - From IPFS - **MISSING**
- ❌ `description` - From IPFS - **MISSING**
- ❌ `creator` - Proposer address - **HAS (as "proposer")**

### **Nice to Have:**

- `ipfsHash` - For fetching metadata
- `quorum` - Quorum threshold
- Voting breakdown by address

---

## 🚀 Recommended Fixes

1. **Verify ABI is correct** - Check against actual contract
2. **Fix tuple parsing** - Ensure correct order and types
3. **Add IPFS fetching** - Get title/description
4. **Add state validation** - Ensure state is 0-7
5. **Add executed/canceled flags** - Critical for status display

---

## 💡 Quick Test

Try this to verify the ABI:

```javascript
const proposal = await governanceContract.getProposal(32);
console.log("Raw proposal:", proposal);
console.log("State:", proposal.state?.toString());
console.log("StartTime:", proposal.startTime?.toString());
console.log("EndTime:", proposal.endTime?.toString());
console.log("Executed:", proposal.executed);
console.log("Canceled:", proposal.canceled);
```

This will help identify if the issue is:

- ABI definition
- Parsing logic
- Contract method
